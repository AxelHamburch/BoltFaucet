BoltFaucet is a Telegram bot that enables easy, secure Satoshis giveaways through the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
Thanks to Telegram user authentication and LNbits voucher integration, BoltFaucet ensures every withdrawal is legitimate and abuse-proof.

## What do I need and how do I set up BoltFaucet?

You‚Äôll need an LNbits wallet, a Telegram bot, and this repository. That‚Äôs it!

1. Create an LNbits wallet and get the admin key for your wallet.
2. Create a new bot using [t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and obtain the access token.
3. Use [t.me/userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to find out your own Telegram user ID.
4. Install the required dependencies and clone the project on your server:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3.11-venv python3.11-distutils
    git clone https://github.com/AxelHamburch/BoltFaucet.git
    ```
5. Create a `.env` file and open it for editing:
    ```bash
    cd BoltFaucet
    cp example.env .env
    nano .env
    ```
6. At minimum, update the following settings in the `.env` file:
   - LNbits API key
   - LNbits URL
   - Telegram Bot Access Token
   - Deine Telegram Chat/User-ID
   
7. Install the Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3.11 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install Wheel
    python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
8. Start the application:
    ```bash
     python3.11 app.py
    ```
9.  Save the `HomepageButton.html` file locally and replace `YourBotName_bot` in the first line of the public link with the name of your own bot.
10. Double-click the HTML file to open it and display the button.
11. Click the button to be redirected to your bot for testing.
12. The bot should now display a voucher for you. üéâ

As an admin, you can generate as many vouchers as you like. All other users are limited to one voucher. Each user's Telegram ID is stored in the database. If a user tries to claim a second time, they will receive a notification.

> Hey @user, you‚Äôve already claimed 21 sats üéâ
> Let‚Äôs keep it fair‚Äîthanks! üôè

You can use the `/stats` command in the bot to display a small statistics overview.

## BoltFaucet Autostart Service

1. Create new system service:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/boltfaucet.service
```

2. Fill in the file with the following information and customize `youruser` in __five__ places:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=boltfaucet
After=network.target

[Service]
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/home/youruser/boltfaucet
EnvironmentFile=/home/youruser/boltfaucet/.env
ExecStart=/home/youruser/boltfaucet/venv/bin/python /home/youruser/boltfaucet/app.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Activate, start and monitor:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable boltfaucet
sudo systemctl start boltfaucet
sudo systemctl status boltfaucet
```

From now on, boltfaucet will start automatically with every restart. üéâ

However, if you have problems, you can call up the logs with the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u boltfaucet -f --since "2 hour ago"
```

BoltFaucet is a Telegram bot that enables easy, secure Satoshis giveaways through the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
Thanks to Telegram user authentication and LNbits voucher integration, BoltFaucet ensures every withdrawal is legitimate and abuse-proof.

> Based on original work by [DoktorShift](https://github.com/DoktorShift).


### Features

- ⚡ Lightning-Fast Satoshi Withdrawals — powered by LNURL-withdraw and LNbits.
- 🔒 User Authentication — prevents faucet abuse by linking Telegram user IDs.
- 📲 One-Click Claiming — users simply tap a button to receive a unique QR code.
- 🛡️ Voucher System — backed by LNbits Wallet Accounts for secure voucher generation.
- 🧩 Simple Integration — easily deployable with minimal setup.

### How It Works

1. The user presses a button in Telegram.
2. The bot sends a unique LNURL-withdraw QR code.
3. The user claims their Sats with their Lightning wallet.
4. Telegram ID is stored to prevent multiple claims.

### Why BoltFaucet?

> Prevent faucet abuse. Gift Satoshis with confidence.

Built for projects, communities, and Lightning fans who want to share sats — without worrying about spam or exploitation.


## What do I need and how do I set up BoltFaucet?

You’ll need an LNbits wallet, a Telegram bot, and this repository. That’s it!

1. Create an LNbits wallet and get the admin key for your wallet.
2. Create a new bot using [t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and obtain the access token.
3. Use [t.me/userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to find out your own Telegram user ID.
4. Install the required dependencies and clone the project on your server:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3.11-venv python3.11-distutils
    git clone https://github.com/AxelHamburch/BoltFaucet.git
    ```
5. Create a `.env` file and open it for editing:
    ```bash
    cd BoltFaucet
    cp example.env .env
    nano .env
    ```
6. At minimum, update the following settings in the `.env` file:
   - LNbits API key
   - LNbits URL
   - Telegram Bot Access Token
   - Deine Telegram Chat/User-ID
   
7. Install the Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3.11 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install Wheel
    python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
8. Start the application:
    ```bash
     python3.11 app.py
    ```
9.  Save the `HomepageButton.html` file locally and replace `YourBotName_bot` in the first line of the public link with the name of your own bot.
10. Double-click the HTML file to open it and display the button.
11. Click the button to be redirected to your bot for testing.
12. The bot should now display a voucher for you. 🎉

As an admin, you can generate as many vouchers as you like. All other users are limited to one voucher. Each user's Telegram ID is stored in the database. If a user tries to claim a second time, they will receive a notification.

> Hey @user, you’ve already claimed 21 sats 🎉
> Let’s keep it fair—thanks! 🙏

You can use the `/stats` command in the bot to display a small statistics overview.

## BoltFaucet Autostart Service

1. Create new system service:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/boltfaucet.service
```

2. Fill in the file with the following information and customize `youruser` in __five__ places:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=boltfaucet
After=network.target

[Service]
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/home/youruser/boltfaucet
EnvironmentFile=/home/youruser/boltfaucet/.env
ExecStart=/home/youruser/boltfaucet/venv/bin/python /home/youruser/boltfaucet/app.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Activate, start and monitor:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable boltfaucet
sudo systemctl start boltfaucet
sudo systemctl status boltfaucet
```

From now on, boltfaucet will start automatically with every restart. 🎉

However, if you have problems, you can call up the logs with the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u boltfaucet -f --since "2 hour ago"
```
